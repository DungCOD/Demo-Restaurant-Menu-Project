# Demo Restaurant Menu Project
A restaurant needs to design a database for its menu. We have design a simple SQL database and connect it with C++ source codes in order to implement a demo for the project. In order to run this project, Dev C++ IDE and MySQL is recommended.  
#
The requirements are:
+ There are multiple categories of dishes (desert, main dish, snack, ....)
+ There are multiple origins of dishes, one dish might have multiple origins as well (north, south, japan, ...)
+ A dish should be made from multiple core Ingredients
+ A dish should have a price, name.
+ Some dishes are not available in a particular time (day and night) so the restaurant may want to hide them from the menu. 
+ An ingredient should have the quantity, import date, expired date.
+ The counting unit of an ingredient can be kg, gram, bottle, ...

Design such database. insert at least 10 dishes into the database.
Write a program allows people to:
1. View the menu
2. Search menu by categories and origins
3. See each dish details (ingredient, name, price, ..)
4. See ingredient details.
